What is happening in this program is three main components. The first part breaks down the argument into specific words. The way that it does this is by iterating through the string starting from the first alphabetical character it sees until the first seperator or non alphabetical character. It would then take the location of the beginning part of the word until the end and then put it into a node for the linked list. This is where the second part of the program comes into play. This is the insertion but in the insertion it calls the last component which is the compare function. These way that these two functions work is that when there is a node that needs to be inserted, it is first compared to whatever is already in the linked list so that it can be inputed into the correct spot. This would mean that after everything is in the linked list there does not need to be another sort later on in the program. The insert both inserts the node and compares it so that it goes to the correct spot in the linked list. Once the argument has been broken down into all the words and have been put in the linked list, then the linked list is printed out since it is already in the correct order.
